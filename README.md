I am a bright and enthusiastic **Ruby junior developer**.
After completing my Masters degree in Maths and Physics at the University of Warwick, I decided to start a Maths PhD at the University of Manchester.
After 18 months I decided I wanted to move away from theoretical work and pivot towards a career in Tech.
I want to apply my love of problem solving to concrete challenges and help build new and exiting software using the skills I acquired at [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy).

## Tech skills

- Javascript (Node.js, React, Express, Jest, Cypress)
- Ruby (Sinatra, RSpec, RuboCop)
- HTML/CSS (Tailwind CSS)
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Git and GitHub

## Experience

#### University of Manchester _(Oct. 2020 to Jun. 2022)_

PhD in Applied Mathematics (DISCONTINUED) “Fast and Reliable Algorithms for High-Performance Numerical Linear Algebra”, Supervised by Prof. N. Higham and Prof. F. Tisseur

- Research and Create new algorithms to perform basic linear algebra operations using multiple floating point precisions
- Analyse the numerical behaviour of algorithms in floating point arithmetic
- Implement algorithms and test their accuracy and efficiency using MATLAB

## Skills

#### Quick Learner

Throughout my academic projects, I have had to independently learn tools used in specific fields.
During my Masters project I had to Blender and how to automate rendering using its Python API.
Then in my PhD, I rapidly learned MATLAB to write numerical experiments.
At Makers Academy, I have furthered this skill through learning Ruby and Javascript and related technologies such as Sinatra, React and Express.
As such I feel confident learning any required technical skill independently and rapidly given any project.

#### Communication

As a PhD student I have presented my work to audiences with different levels of familiarity with my work.
This has taught me to communicate clearly and efficiently and to carefully chose the level of detail with which to present my ideas.
I have also learned how to work and communicate as part of a team through collaborative projects at Makers Academy, and pair programming has helped teach me how to communicate technical ideas well.

#### Organisation

My studies have required me to be able to work independently and towards deadlines.
In order to do so I have learned to organise myself by prioritising tasks and I am able to evaluate my progress in case I need to revaluate those priorities.

#### Other Skills

Languages: Bilingual English and French, limited working Spanish

## Education
