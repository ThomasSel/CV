I am a bright and enthusiastic **Ruby junior developper**.
After completing my Masters degree in Maths and Physics at the University of Warwick, I decided to start a Maths PhD at the University of Manchester.
After 18 months I decided I wanted to move away from theoretical work and pivot towards a career in Tech.
I want to apply my love of problem solving to concrete challenges and help build new and exiting software using the skills I acquired at [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy).

## Experience

**University of Manchester** (Oct. 2020 to Jun. 2022)  
PhD in Applied Mathematics (DISCONTINUED) “Fast and Reliable Algorithms for High-Performance Numerical Linear Algebra”, Supervised by Prof. N. Higham and Prof. F. Tisseur

- Reserching and creating new algorithms to perform basic linear algbra kernels using multiple floating point precisions. 
- Using MATLAB to implement and test algorithms for accuracy and efficiency.

## Skills

#### Quick Learner

Throughout my accademic projects, I have had to independently learn the tools used in specific fields.
During my Masters project I had to rapidly learn Blender and how to render Blender frames using a Python API.
Then in my PhD, I rapidly learning MATLAB in order to focus on my research.
I have since developped this skill throughout my time in the Makers Academy by learning even more programming languages and technologies. 

#### Communication

During my time as a PhD student I have had to present my work to audiences with different levels of familiarity with my work.
This has taught me how to communicate clearly and efficiently and to carefully chose the level of detail with which to present my ideas.
I have also learned how to communicate with my team through collaborative projects and pair programming at Makers Academy.

#### Organisation

My studies have required me to be able to work independently and towards deadlines.
In order to do so I have learned to organise myself by prioritising tasks and I am able to evaluate my progress in case I need to revaluate those priorities. 

#### Other Skills

Languages: Bilingual English and French, limited working Spanish

## Education
