## About me

I am a bright and enthusiastic **junior full-stack developer** looking to continue my journey in the tech industry working with a team on projects that have a beneficial impact on society.

After completing my Masters degree in Maths and Physics at the University of Warwick, I decided to start a Maths PhD at the University of Manchester.
I enjoyed the programming work during in my academic career, but I felt like my career would never allow me to create tangible things that others could understand and use.
After 18 months I decided I wanted to move away from theoretical research to more applied work, and software development seemed like a great choice for me to pivot to.

I want to build on the skills I've acquired at [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy) and apply my love of problem solving to concrete challenges with the goal of building new and exciting software that I can be proud of.

## Tech skills

- Javascript (Node.js, React, Express, Jest, Cypress)
- Ruby (Sinatra, RSpec, RuboCop)
- HTML/CSS (Tailwind CSS)
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Git and GitHub

## Experience

#### University of Manchester _(Oct. 2020 to Jun. 2022)_

PhD in Applied Mathematics (DISCONTINUED) “Fast and Reliable Algorithms for High-Performance Numerical Linear Algebra”, Supervised by Prof. N. Higham and Prof. F. Tisseur

- Research and Create new algorithms to perform basic linear algebra operations using multiple floating point precisions
- Analyse the numerical behaviour of algorithms in floating point arithmetic
- Implement algorithms and test their accuracy and efficiency using MATLAB

## Skills

#### Analytical Thinking

Studying Maths taught me analytical thinking through the heavy emphasis on rationally proving every statement.
This emphasis has influenced how I tackle programming problems, by helping me identify and focus on edge cases and errors that could occur, as well as ensuring my code follows a logical progression.

#### Problem Solving

At University I was supplied with a stream of problems where I had to apply theoretical knowledge to come up with solutions.
These problems gradually became larger in scope, especially with my Masters and PhD projects which taught me to organise my work and deconstruct problems into manageable chunks.
Makers Academy provided opportunities to apply this to tech problems with both small scale problem solving (eg debugging) as well as larger scale thinking such as how to organise and develop projects from the ground up, particularly in our final project.
In particular I really enjoyed the 'refactor' stage in the TDD process because it gave me the freedom to think of different, more elegant ways of solving problems.

#### Quick Learner

Throughout my academic projects, I have had to independently learn tools used in specific fields.
During my Masters project I had to learn how to use Blender and how to automate rendering using its Python API.
Then in my PhD, I rapidly learned MATLAB to write numerical experiments.
At Makers Academy, I have furthered this skill through learning Ruby and Javascript and related technologies such as Sinatra, React and Express.
As such I feel confident learning any required technical skill independently and rapidly given any project.

#### Communication

As a PhD student I have presented my work to audiences with different levels of familiarity with my work.
This has taught me to communicate clearly and efficiently and to carefully chose the level of detail with which to present my ideas.
I have also learned how to work and communicate as part of a team through collaborative projects at Makers Academy, and pair programming has helped teach me how to communicate technical ideas well.

#### Other Skills

Languages: Bilingual English and French, limited working Spanish
